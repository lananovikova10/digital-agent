      "content": "Hey all!\nI recently gave a workshop talk at PyCon Greece 2025 about building production-ready agent systems.<p>To check the workshop, I put together a demo repo: (I will add the slides too soon in my blog: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.petrostechchronicles.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.petrostechchronicles.com&#x2F;</a>)\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aherontas&#x2F;Pycon_Greece_2025_Presentation_Agents\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aherontas&#x2F;Pycon_Greece_2025_Presentation_...</a><p>The idea was to show how multiple AI agents can collaborate using FastAPI + Pydantic-AI, with protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) for safe communication and orchestration.<p>Features:<p>- Multiple agents running in containers<p>- MCP servers (Brave search, GitHub, filesystem, etc.) as tools<p>- A2A communication between services<p>- Minimal UI for experimentation for Tech Trend - repo analysis<p>I built this repo because most agent frameworks look great in isolated demos, but fall apart when you try to glue agents together into a real application. My goal was to help people experiment with these patterns and move closer to real-world use cases.<p>It\u2019s not production-grade, but would love feedback, criticism, or war stories from anyone who\u2019s tried building actual multi-agent systems.\nBig questions:<p>Do you think agent-to-agent protocols like MCP&#x2F;A2A will stick?<p>Or will the future be mostly single powerful LLMs with plugin stacks?<p>Thanks \u2014 excited to hear what the HN crowd thinks!",

To solve this, we built a library that generates them on the fly, enabling 1-click installation buttons and links for most clients out there.<p>Feel free to try out the generator and use it to improve the README of your remote MCP server with the generated markdown. You can even configure the library to return HTML instructions if someone accesses your remote MCP server via the web.",

Nanobot makes it simple to wrap any MCP server with reasoning, a system prompt, and orchestration so it behaves like a real agent. Even better, Nanobot fully supports MCP-UI, so agents can pass rich interactive components (forms, dashboards, even mini-apps) directly into chat.<p>A simple example: if you had a Blackjack MCP server with tools like deal, bet, and hit, you could wrap it with Nanobot to create a dealer agent that knows how to explain the game, guide a player, and render an interactive Blackjack table inside chat.<p>We built this because we wanted agents that go beyond text and function calls, into actual interactive experiences\u2014something useful for everything from games to e-commerce to developer tools.<p>Code is on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nanobot-ai&#x2F;nanobot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nanobot-ai&#x2F;nanobot</a><p>Live demo (Blackjack): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blackjack.nanobot.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blackjack.nanobot.ai</a><p>We\u2019d love feedback from this community\u2014on the framework, the design, and what you\u2019d like to see next.",
